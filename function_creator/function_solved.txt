To ensure the code runs only for a specific endpoint, you need to define an Azure Function with an HTTP trigger that will execute the code only when the specified endpoint is hit. Below is a simplified and structured example of how to integrate your existing Python class into an Azure Function that triggers on HTTP requests to a specific endpoint.

1. **Set up the Azure Function App**: Make sure you have the Azure Functions development environment ready with the necessary configuration for Python.

2. **Define the HTTP Trigger for Azure Function**:

```python
import azure.functions as func
from .nicecxone_elasticsearch import NicecxoneElasticsearch  # Assuming your class is in this module

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    try:
        # Instantiate the main class
        nice_elasticsearch = NicecxoneElasticsearch()
        
        # Trigger the synchronization method (or any method you want to run)
        nice_elasticsearch.sync_data()
        
        return func.HttpResponse(
            "Data synchronization process completed successfully.",
            status_code=200
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return func.HttpResponse(
            f"Error occurred: {str(e)}",
            status_code=500
        )
```

3. **Configure the `function.json`**:
   Make sure to configure the `function.json` in the Azure Function to set the bindings and constraints including the method and the route. Here's an example configuration if you want to trigger the function on a POST request to `/sync-data` endpoint:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": ["post"],
      "route": "sync-data"
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. **Deploy Your Function**:
   Deploy your function to Azure Functions. Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed in your environment, and your function app settings are correctly configured, including environment variables.

5. **Test Your Endpoint**:
   Once deployed, test the endpoint by sending a POST request to the URL provided by Azure Functions which will be something like `https://<your-function-app>.azurewebsites.net/api/sync-data`.

This setup ensures that your Python class and methods are encapsulated within an Azure Function that activates only when the specific endpoint (`/sync-data` in this example) is accessed. Adjust the route and methods as per your requirements.
