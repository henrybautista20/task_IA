### SharePoint

1. **Purpose**

The SharePoint connector for Elasticsearch facilitates synchronization of SharePoint activity and usage data. It integrates with Microsoft Graph API to pull detailed information on SharePoint usage, including user interactions, file activities, site usage details, and much more. This synchronization aids in monitoring SharePoint environments, optimizing content management, and enhancing collaboration across the organization.

2. **Requirements**

To utilize the SharePoint connector, ensure Azure Active Directory app registrations are configured with the necessary permissions for accessing SharePoint data via the Microsoft Graph API.

3. **Microsoft Graph API Authentication**

For accessing SharePoint data, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app registrations must be set up with required permissions, specifically Reports.Read.All. Authentication involves Azure Graph API credentials including `app_ids`, `app_secrets`, `tenants_for_login`, and OAuth tokens. Each customer must have OAuth tokens to authenticate API requests, ensuring secure and authorized data access.

4. **Data Sources**

Endpoint Name | Endpoint URL | Necessary Permission
--- | --- | ---
getSharePointActivityUserDetail | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/reports/getSharePointActivityUserDetail(date={date_value})` | Reports.Read.All
getSharePointSiteUsageDetail | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/reports/getSharePointSiteUsageDetail(date={date_value})` |
