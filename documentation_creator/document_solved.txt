**Intune Device Manager API Documentation (managedDevices)**

1. **Purpose**

The Intune Device Manager API connector for Elasticsearch enables the synchronization of device management data via Microsoft Graph API. This connector supports the efficient monitoring and management of organizational devices, providing insights into device statuses, configurations, and compliance.

2. **Requirements**

To utilize the Intune Device Manager API, organizations need Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app registrations configured with precise permissions for comprehensive device data access.

**Microsoft Graph API Authentication:**

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app registrations must be configured with permissions such as DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All to access relevant device data. These registrations require Azure Graph API credentials including app_ids, app_secrets, and tenants_for_login. OAuth tokens are essential for each customer, serving as a secure method to authenticate API requests and ensure data privacy and integrity.

3. **Data Sources**

Endpoint Name: managedDevices  
Endpoint URL: /deviceManagement/managedDevices  
Necessary Permission: DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All
